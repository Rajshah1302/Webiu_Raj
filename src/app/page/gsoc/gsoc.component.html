    <p>
      This is the 7th time that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use
      this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above
      mentioned areas. Please note that anyone who is interested can participate
      in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest
      possible project ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to
      improve or heip you with them. Please keep in mind that projects need to
      be realistically something that is able to be functionally completed by a
      student working full time for about eight weeks. Thanks!

    <h3>Important Guidelines on Submitting Ideas</h3>
    <p>
      There are some important guidelines to submit ideas, please read these
      carefully before adding your ideas!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        There is a fixed time period for implementing and coding your ideas
      </li>
      <li>
        Come up with attainable goals and you will be able to complete what you
        set out to do. You can always contact our mentors and community and get
        an idea about the workload and whether you might be able to complete
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are free to come up with your own ideas. The ideas should be about
        Internet of Things (IOT), Computer Security and Software Tools. Also if
        you love to work on any of these subjects but do not have an idea you
        can always contact us.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lets Talk! The best way to solve problems that you might have is to
        contact our mentors and also our community.
      </li>
      <li>
        We encourage you to do documentation so that we can keep track of your
        progress and also help you if things are not going according to plan.
        Although not compulsory we have a strong belief that this method can cut
        down your time to code and also the workload of the mentors drastically.
      </li>
      <li>Please send your new project ideas to gsoc[at]c2si.com</li>
